# codingjuntos_advent2020

This is a project for us to practice different languages together.

Also have some fun with github.

Let's see what this season has in store for us :)

Also playing with github pages and workflows. And checking if the update today in this site will **work** 

The repo name is 2020, but was used for some testing in 2021 and continuing now on 2022 :)
